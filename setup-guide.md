## 📋 Prerequisites

- 10-15 minutes of setup time

## 🎯 Step 1: Create Back4App Account

### 1.1 Sign Up

2. Click **"Sign up for free"** (top right corner)
3. Choose one of these options:
   - **GitHub**: Quick signup with your GitHub account
   - **Google**: Sign up with your Google account  
   - **Email**: Manual registration with email/password
4. Complete the verification process (check your email if needed)

### 1.2 First Login

- Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the interface

## 🏗️ Step 2: Create Your WorkTime Tracker App

### 2.1 Create New App
1. Click **"Build new app"** (big blue button)
2. Select **"Backend as a Service"** option
3. Fill in app details:
   - **App name**: `BMW WorkTime Tracker`
   - **Choose a subdomain**: `your-name-worktime` (or any unique name)
4. Click **"Create"** and wait for provisioning (30-60 seconds)

### 2.2 App Dashboard
- You'll be taken to your new app's dashboard
- Bookmark this page - you'll return here often!

## 🔑 Step 3: Get Your App Credentials

### 3.1 Access Security Settings
1. In your app dashboard, click **"App Settings"** (left sidebar)
2. Click **"Security & Keys"**
3. You'll see several important credentials:

### 3.2 Copy These Values (IMPORTANT!)
You'll need these exact values for configuration:

**Application ID**: `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
- Copy this entire string

**JavaScript Key**: `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`  
- Copy this entire string

**Server URL**: Usually `https://parseapi.back4app.com/`
- Copy this exact URL (with trailing slash)

### 3.3 Keep Credentials Safe
- **Don't share these publicly** - they're like passwords for your app
- Save them in a text file temporarily for the next step

## ⚙️ Step 4: Enable Required Features

### 4.1 User Authentication
1. Go to **"App Settings"** > **"Features"**
2. Ensure these are enabled:
   - ✅ **User sessions**
   - ✅ **Public registration** (allows new users to sign up)
   - ✅ **Email verification** (recommended for security)

### 4.2 Security Settings
1. Go to **"App Settings"** > **"Security & Keys"**
2. Under **"Client Class Creation"**, ensure it's **enabled**
3. This allows the app to create database tables automatically

## 🔧 Step 5: Configure Your App

### 5.1 Update config.js
1. Open your BMW WorkTime Tracker folder
2. Edit the `config.js` file
3. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```javascript
// Replace these with your actual Back4App credentials
const CONFIG = {
    APP_ID: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_HERE',
    JS_KEY: 'YOUR_JAVASCRIPT_KEY_HERE', 
    SERVER_URL: 'https://parseapi.back4app.com/'
};
```

### 5.2 Example Configuration
Your `config.js` should look like this (with your real values):

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    APP_ID: 'abc123def456ghi789',
    JS_KEY: 'xyz789uvw456rst123',
    SERVER_URL: 'https://parseapi.back4app.com/'
};

// Initialize Parse
Parse.initialize(CONFIG.APP_ID, CONFIG.JS_KEY);
Parse.serverURL = CONFIG.SERVER_URL;
```

## 🧪 Step 6: Test Your Setup

### 6.1 Test Authentication
1. Open `login.html` in your browser
2. Try creating a new account:
   - Use a real email address
   - Choose a secure password
3. If successful, you should be redirected to the main app

### 6.2 Test Data Sync
1. Create some work sessions in the app
2. Check Back4App dashboard:
   - Go to **"Database"** > **"Browser"**
   - You should see new tables: `WorkSession`, `ActiveSession`, `UserData`
3. Logout and login again - your data should persist
